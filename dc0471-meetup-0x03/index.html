										</header>
									<p><b>Bio:</b> A Security enthusiast with sound knowledge of Linux binary exploitation and web penetration testing. I love to play with secure systems and always tries to find innovative ways to crack systems.
MTech from IIT Kanpur with specialization in System Security. Have experience in Cyber Security Lab IIT Kanpur and System Security team Samsung R&D centre Delhi. Currently working in Infosec team @Walmartlabs India.</p>
			<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many environments deploys database systems which are administered by centralized authority. Theauthority is capable enough to make modifications to database entries that goes unnoticed withmodification of access logs.
											These kinds of threats are Insider threats where the person having soundknowledge of internal network and administrative access can fiddle with the data. Logging does notproves to be a good way to detect such threats as attacker having access to the host can tamper thelogs accordingly.</p><p>In this paper we are going to present a techniques where the unauthorized changes made by attackercan be identified within a database system by minor changes to it. The idea extends the the tamperresistant behaviour of blockchain that adds meta-data (we call this meta-data as token) to each row todetect insider access. The technique have been implemented & tested with dummy HR managementapplication in which access to the entries is restricted with policies.</p>

										</header>
									<p><b>Bio:</b> Anjana is a security Researcher at Cloudsek. She has over 2 years of experience in the cyber security. She loves painting and travelling. </p>
										<p><b>Abstract:</b> SQL injection is one of the most dangerous attacks existing in modern universe due to its high impact upon successful exploit. Proper input validation and use of parameterized queries help developers mitigate this issue successfully. However, the same injection vulnerability can be exploited using connection strings as well. The fact that a coordinated effort between developers, database vendors and system admins is required to mitigate this vulnerability increases the potential of this attack.
The paper will explain the injection attacks that can be performed using connection strings. It will take you through various injection scenarios, injection vectors and a demo showcasing the attack. The paper is concluded with the mitigation strategies for the attack. </p>

										<p><b>Abstract:</b> The firmware of TP-Link router is downloaded from the internet. The reverse engineering of the firmware is done with binwalk and firmware-mod-toolkit. After extraction, a suitable payload is generated via Metasploit based on the firmware in suitable elf format. After payload generation, the payload is binded with /etc/init.d file or with any other scripts in that directory. The modified firmware is finally compiled and put together. After the flashing of the firmware in the router, the msf reverse shell is obtained from the router to the attacker machine and a command shell is opened.

										<p><b>Aravind Prakash, HackIT Technology and Advisory Services</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio:</b> Aravind is a Security enthusiast working as Security Analyst at HackIT Technology and Advisory Services. He has 1 year experience in InfoSec. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in computer science. He worked in computer networking for 1.5 years. He loves travelling.  </p>
										<p><b>Abstract:</b> ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) Stack traditionally a log monitoring system. It is used for infrastructure monitoring with help of logs from different devices and services that are configured to send logs to the centralized ELK server in the infrastructure. With ELK we can look beyond log monitoring. Since the working of ELK is that, its process any file that is feed into the processing stream. We can filter that file to ours need. Because of this ELK can deal with any file format that is not a necessarily log file. Let’s take example, if we are doing a port scan with nmap and created an output file for the result , this file can be added into ELK and we can visualize the output in kibana for different parameters of the output. Nmap is a single example, any tool that can create an output can be added into ELK.

We will go through how easy is to configure ELK and how to configure it for your various scanning tools. </p>

										<p><b>Manish Gupta, Societe Generale Global Solution Center</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio:</b> Manish Gupta is a Cyber Security Analyst at Societe Generale in India. Where he specializes in Offensive Security and Red Teaming Activities on Banking Environment. A part-time Bug Bounty Hunter and CTF Player. His Research interest includes Real World Cyber Attack Simulation and Advanced persistent Threat (APT). He currently working on developing Open-Source Offensive Security Toolkit which helps Red Teamers / Penetration Testers. </p>
										<p><b>Abstract:</b> PivotSuite is a portable, platform independent and powerful network pivoting toolkit, Which helps Red Teamers / Penetration Testers to use a compromised system to move around inside a network. It is a Standalone Utility, Which can use as a Server or as a Client.
PivotSuite as a Server: If the Compromised host is directly accessable (Forward Connection) from Our pentest machine, Then we can run pivotsuite as a server on compromised machine and access the different subnet hosts from our pentest machine, Which was only accessable from compromised machine.
PivotSuite as a Client: If the Compromised host is behind a Firewall / NAT and isn't directly accessible from our pentest machine, Then we can run pivotsuite as a server on pentest machine and pivotsuite as a client on compromised machine for creating a reverse tunnel. Using this we can reach different subnet hosts from our pentest machine, which was only accessible from compromised machine. </p>
