										<h4><font color="#f75656">Talk #1</font>: Vulnerabilities in Blockchain</h4>
										<p><b>Shobha Jagathpal, Walmart Labs</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio:</b> Shobha Jagathpal has spent over 19 years on various information technology disciplines, focusing primarily on enterprise application development and consultation. Over the course of her career, Shobha has held increasingly engineering and management roles. As an information security practitioner, Shobha has extensive experience in Public Key Infrastructure, Web services security, Identity and Access Management, Incident and Event Management, Compliance Assessment, Vulnerability Assessment, Risk Assessment, GRC application customizations and integrating security tools to build enterprise solutions. She has managed all aspects of Software Development Life Cycle delivering world class products. </p>
										<p><b>Abstract:</b> Adoption of Blockchain has increased globally addressing various use cases referred to as Smart Contract apart from the main stream crypto currency use. As a result there has been increase in the Blockchain implementations involving various technologies so are the vulnerabilities introduced by developers from this implementations. Starting from the crypto layer, list of vulnerabilities associated with block chain will be presented with a show case of exploit impacting entire implementation of a Smart contract based Blockchain loose stakeholder trust. </p>

										<h4><font color="#f75656">Talk #2</font>: Polluting the DB connection: Connection string injection attacks</h4>
										<p><b>Anjana Sathyan, CloudSek</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio:</b> Anjana is a security Researcher at Cloudsek. She has over 2 years of experience in the cyber security. She loves painting and travelling. </p>
										<p><b>Abstract:</b> SQL injection is one of the most dangerous attacks existing in modern universe due to its high impact upon successful exploit. Proper input validation and use of parameterized queries help developers mitigate this issue successfully. However, the same injection vulnerability can be exploited using connection strings as well. The fact that a coordinated effort between developers, database vendors and system admins is required to mitigate this vulnerability increases the potential of this attack.
The paper will explain the injection attacks that can be performed using connection strings. It will take you through various injection scenarios, injection vectors and a demo showcasing the attack. The paper is concluded with the mitigation strategies for the attack. </p>

										<p><b>Nishit Majithia, Walmart Labs</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio:</b> Nishit Majithia is currently working as a security penetration tester at Walmart Labs, India. Earlier Nishit was a software developer in InfoSec Walmart Labs India team. Nishit has sound knowledge of java and c, c++, go and python. All fundamentals like operating system, data structures, database, network are very well familiar to Nishit. During the internship time of his B.Tech degree, he contributed one payload in ISRO's IMS-1A satellite. After getting M.Tech degree in Cyber Security area from IIT Kanpur, Nishit developed his curiosity in this security research field and that gave him the opportunity to represent himself in DefCon-2018 India Chapter.</p>

									<p><b>Bio:</b> A Security enthusiast with sound knowledge of Linux binary exploitation and web penetration testing. I love to play with secure systems and always tries to find innovative ways to crack systems.
MTech from IIT Kanpur with specialization in System Security. Have experience in Cyber Security Lab IIT Kanpur and System Security team Samsung R&D centre Delhi. Currently working in Infosec team @Walmartlabs India.</p>
			<p><b>Abstract:</b> Many environments deploys database systems which are administered by centralized authority. Theauthority is capable enough to make modifications to database entries that goes unnoticed withmodification of access logs.
											These kinds of threats are Insider threats where the person having soundknowledge of internal network and administrative access can fiddle with the data. Logging does notproves to be a good way to detect such threats as attacker having access to the host can tamper thelogs accordingly.</p><p>In this paper we are going to present a techniques where the unauthorized changes made by attackercan be identified within a database system by minor changes to it. The idea extends the the tamperresistant behaviour of blockchain that adds meta-data (we call this meta-data as token) to each row todetect insider access. The technique have been implemented & tested with dummy HR managementapplication in which access to the entries is restricted with policies.</p>

			<p><b>Abstract:</b> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Being a young framework, the platform has gained significant popularity among developers and is one of the preferred choices for front stack development. Despite its popularity and increased usage, very less amount of research is focused on secure coding practices for react.
This paper tries to gain insights on what are the existing vulnerabilities present in react-js and their corresponding secure coding practices. Additionally, a demo showcasing the comparison of existing open source static analysis tools based on their efficiency in identifying these vulnerabilities.</p>
