										<h4><font color="#f75656">Talk #1</font>: Web application firewalls: Analysis of OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set & detection logic</h4>
										<p><b>Josna Joseph, EY</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio: </b>Josna Joseph is working as a security analyst, specialized in web application and mobile application security review. She has 3 years of experience in Information security domain.</p>
									<p><b>Abstract: </b>The proliferation of web application and the pervasiveness of mobile technology make web-based attacks even more attractive and even easier to launch. Web Application Firewall (WAF) is an intermediate tool between web server and users that provides comprehensive protection for web application. WAF is a negative security model where the detection and prevention mechanisms are based on predefined or user-defined attack signatures and patterns. However, WAF alone is not adequate to offer best defensive system against web vulnerabilities that are increasing in number and complexity daily. The objectives of this study are to investigate the possibility of constructing a better security model for WAF by analysing the OWASP CRS & detection logic. The main contribution of this paper is the methodology to evaluate a WAF system based on its underlying working principle. </br><a href="#">[Slides]</a></p>

										<h4><font color="#f75656">Talk #2</font>: Shifting Security Left Into the Application</h4>
										<p><b>Atul Singh, Xento Systems</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio: </b> Atul Singh is a Pentester, Speaker, Trainer and Cyber Security Enthusiast, currently working with Xento Systems, Pune. His main interest is in Application Security (Web/Mobile), DevSecOps, Android Things.He Loves Knowing What’s Going On (emerging vulns, tools, PoC), CTFs, Offensive Security Work, Cricket, and no compromise with food and coffee.</p>
									<p><b>Abstract: </b> Behind the idea of this "Shifting Security Left Into the Application" is that you move application quality and security considerations closer to the developer, so the potential issues are avoided or resolved sooner, even before the code is committed. Another reason we are having issues with securing software is that traditional security teams have focused on just the productivity not the security of the application. This means shifting left has a clear ROI, simply by addressing issues at the point of origin. In contrast, in traditional development, there is a dedicated team for security and a team for quality. Their general mode of operation is to respond to issues, not necessarily prevent them, because once code moves to integration or production, it’s often too late to take precautionary measures. The other problem is that IT teams are focused on system-level security, which is different than application security, where sneaky issues can surface off the radar. This has crippled companies, especially when it comes to security, where the actual cost of the issue is unbounded, unlike a bug where there is an upper limit.
So when security issues arises, it is disruptive and expensive. This is why "Shifting Left" security makes sense. </br><a href="#">[Slides]</a></p>

									<h4><font color="#f75656">Talk #1</font>: Portable Pirate Radio with RDS: Broadcast Signal Intrusion with SDR </h4>
										<p><b>Vipin George, Faculty, College of Engineering, Kallooppara</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio: </b> Vipin is a Cyber Forensicator and FOSS enthusiast with 7 years of experience in various Infrastructure Management applications including
Network Monitoring Systems deployed and maintained for a Tier 1 ISP. He is into HF and FM radio DXing and has won prizes from international broadcasters. His
FCC issued US amateur radio call sign is KC9VED and Indian Ham radio call sign is VU3YVG. Presently an AdHoc Faculty at Department of Computer Science,
College of Engineering, Kallooppara. He is also a Mozillian and Wikipedian. Tweets @vipinonline</p>
<p><b>Abstract: </b>  Radio transmissions are insecure by default. This is due to the very nature of one-way wireless links. Radio transmissions can be generated by anyone
with a simple antenna and a matching transmitter. FM radios are everywhere. They use a standard encoding method called Frequency Modulation. Unlike IP networks,
it reaches a massive amount of people. Radio Data System (RDS) allows small amounts of digital information in FM radio broadcasts. We will setup a small
pirate station on a stock Raspberry Pi powerful enough to reach all our participants. It can practically hijack all FM stations in our locality. We have
two options: </p>
<ul>
<li>-> DoS and</li>
<li>-> Sabotage</li>
</ul><p>
It can also be used as a perfect ploy for crossing "air gapped" systems
and leak sensitive data.
We will also run a Number station on RPi, where real one way transmissions to
spies working in foreign countries happens even now.
(http://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/index.htm )
All these are run on a stock RPi with a wire and no other hardware mods
whatsoever.

									<h4><font color="#f75656">Talk #2</font>: Setting up an Infosec Lab 101 : Don't be a skid!</h4>
										<p><b>Nino Stephen Mathew</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio: </b>A passionate security noobie with a  background in system administration (RHCSA) and networking (RHCE). Primarily was more of a dev than a security researcher. Got into security after being fascinated by how malware works. Currently researching on android application reverse engineering and android malware analysis. </p>
									<p><b>Abstract: </b>There are various domains in infosec. Almost every domain requires different setup but what all have in common is a lab in which they can securely experiment and explore new concepts or even really old ones! The presentation is based on my personal experience of setting up a pentesting lab to learn more about infosec. Instead of spoon feeding every single step, the presentation aims more on making the participants understand the importance of setting up a lab. This will also serve as a base class for people who want to get into infosec..</br><a href="#">[Slides]</a></p>
