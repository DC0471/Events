He has also given a talk on "Active Directory Attacks and Detection" at Hakonindia 2017.</p>
									<p><b>Abstract: </b>Microsoft’s LAPS is a tool for managing local administrator passwords of domain joined computers. LAPS stores the passwords/secrets in a cofidential attribute in the computer’s corresponding active directory object. LAPS eliminates the risk of Lateral Movement by generating Random passwords of local administrators. LAPS uses a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) to perform all management tasks like generating password, validating it against the policy, etc.</br></p>
									<p> This talk will be focused on the adversial tactics of abusing LAPS which are as follows:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Identifying users who has ms-Mcs-AdmPwd Read Access** </li>
<li>Dumping LAPS passwords in clear text++</li>
<li>Poisoning AdmPwd.dll*</li>
<li>Modifying searchFlags attribute of ms-Mcs-AdmPwd using DC Shadow+</li>
<li>** Assuming RSAT is enabled on the victim machine</li>
<li>++ Assuming user has “All Extended Rights” permission</li>
<li>* Assuming the user has NT AuthoritySYSTEM Access</li>

									<p><b>Abstract: </b>Dark-Nets are hidden networks where you can operate without being tracked, maintaining total anonymity. These networks avoid their presence on the Surface web and their URLs are tailed with '.onion'.     
The Dark-Net forms a small part of Deep Web, which is the contents search engines have not indexed. For example, government database. Search engines cannot access Deep Web because of database issues, authorization problems, firewall setup etc. The Dark Web is much smaller than the Deep Web and is made up of all different kinds of websites that sell drugs, weapons or even hire assassins.
The Onion Router (ToR), is a free software for enabling anonymous communication. ToR anonymizes the TCP-based applications (e.g. web browsing, secure shell, instant messaging applications). Dark-Net sites which are used for illegal businesses are hosted as ToR hidden services. The ToR users roam around the Internet without any fear of revealing their real identities in front of law enforcement agencies. The surface web which consists of pages that search engines like Google can find and index makes only 10% of the total web.  

ToR protects your privacy and defends against network surveillance and traffic analysis. It prevents others from learning your location and browsing habits. This is implemented by encryption in the application layer of a communication protocol stack, nested like the layers of an onion. It has long been used by Journalists, Researchers or Thrill seekers in heavily censored countries in order to hide their web browsing habits and physical location, crawl the Deep Web and exchange information anonymously.

Dark Web is always defined as something that is illegal and is least seen as a ‘Pool of Information.'</br><a href="#">[Slides]</a></p>

										<p><b>Josna Joseph, EY</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio: </b>Josna Joseph is working as a security analyst, specialized in web application and mobile application security review. She has 3 years of experience in Information security domain.</p>
									<p><b>Abstract: </b>The proliferation of web application and the pervasiveness of mobile technology make web-based attacks even more attractive and even easier to launch. Web Application Firewall (WAF) is an intermediate tool between web server and users that provides comprehensive protection for web application. WAF is a negative security model where the detection and prevention mechanisms are based on predefined or user-defined attack signatures and patterns. However, WAF alone is not adequate to offer best defensive system against web vulnerabilities that are increasing in number and complexity daily. The objectives of this study are to investigate the possibility of constructing a better security model for WAF by analysing the OWASP CRS & detection logic. The main contribution of this paper is the methodology to evaluate a WAF system based on its underlying working principle. </br><a href="#">[Slides]</a></p>

									<h4><font color="#f75656">Talk #7</font>: Portable Pirate Radio with RDS: Broadcast Signal Intrusion with SDR </h4>
										<p><b>Vipin George, Faculty, College of Engineering, Kallooppara</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio: </b> Vipin is a Cyber Forensicator and FOSS enthusiast with 7 years of experience in various Infrastructure Management applications including
Network Monitoring Systems deployed and maintained for a Tier 1 ISP. He is into HF and FM radio DXing and has won prizes from international broadcasters. His
FCC issued US amateur radio call sign is KC9VED and Indian Ham radio call sign is VU3YVG. Presently an AdHoc Faculty at Department of Computer Science,
College of Engineering, Kallooppara. He is also a Mozillian and Wikipedian. Tweets @vipinonline</p>
<p><b>Abstract: </b>  Radio transmissions are insecure by default. This is due to the very nature of one-way wireless links. Radio transmissions can be generated by anyone
with a simple antenna and a matching transmitter. FM radios are everywhere. They use a standard encoding method called Frequency Modulation. Unlike IP networks,
it reaches a massive amount of people. Radio Data System (RDS) allows small amounts of digital information in FM radio broadcasts. We will setup a small
pirate station on a stock Raspberry Pi powerful enough to reach all our participants. It can practically hijack all FM stations in our locality. We have
two options: </p>
<ul>
<li>-> DoS and</li>
<li>-> Sabotage</li>
</ul><p>
It can also be used as a perfect ploy for crossing "air gapped" systems
and leak sensitive data.
We will also run a Number station on RPi, where real one way transmissions to
spies working in foreign countries happens even now.
(http://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/index.htm )
All these are run on a stock RPi with a wire and no other hardware mods
whatsoever.

									<p><b>Abstract: </b>Mobile devices have been an important part of our everyday lives. The increase in the connectivity of these devices to the internet have also increased the trend of exposing vulnerabilities associated with mobile applications.  Attackers try to find some point to exploit these vulnerabilities. This have invited many attackers to write malware for mobile devices exploiting some vulnerability to gain something. The lack of awareness of mobile device owner simplifies the task for attackers. To save such threats it is also not possible to run security models such as IDS, IPS, on these light weight devices. Leading to that fact that once compromised may lead to serious issues. Mobile device such as smart phones, tablets now a days offers good computational & networking resources comparable to computing machines, serving attacks a surface to target.  In 2016, during the mid-November, Checkpoint researchers, revealed an alarming malware, called Gooligan. The malware APK was supposed to have 12 different root exploits, but it is mentioned in same report, that only 2 of them have known CVEs. In this research, an idea has been proposed about how this particular APK malware would have exploited Linux based generic OS vulnerability. Also, very simple yet effective post exploitation fake token-based technique has been presented that makes account breaching by Gooligan like malware detectable. This approach mentioned claims to capture device breaches with an accuracy of 50% at least.</br><a href="#">[Slides]</a></p>

										<p><b>Nino Stephen Mathew</b></p>
										</header>
									<p><b>Bio: </b>A passionate security noobie with a  background in system administration (RHCSA) and networking (RHCE). Primarily was more of a dev than a security researcher. Got into security after being fascinated by how malware works. Currently researching on android application reverse engineering and android malware analysis. </p>
									<p><b>Abstract: </b>There are various domains in infosec. Almost every domain requires different setup but what all have in common is a lab in which they can securely experiment and explore new concepts or even really old ones! The presentation is based on my personal experience of setting up a pentesting lab to learn more about infosec. Instead of spoon feeding every single step, the presentation aims more on making the participants understand the importance of setting up a lab. This will also serve as a base class for people who want to get into infosec..</br><a href="#">[Slides]</a></p>
